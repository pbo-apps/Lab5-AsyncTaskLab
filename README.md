# Lab5-AsyncTaskLab
Lab project from week 1 of Adam Porter's Coursera course, Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 2
https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-programming-2/home/welcome

Lab Objectives:
This weekâ€™s lab aims to give you a better understanding of the AsyncTask class. Upon completing this
lab, you should be able to define and use AsyncTasks to do work without blocking the application's
main Thread. This Lab involves an app that displays simulated Twitter data. Its interface and code
largely manage the selection and display of the data. You will focus on the DownloaderTaskFragment
class, which is responsible for "downloading" the data (this offline version just reads data from a file)
and preparing it for display.
